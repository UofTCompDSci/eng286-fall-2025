    "### A Gentle Introduction to JupyterHub, Jupyter Notebooks, Markdown, and Python Code\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using a collection of tools to help you learn how to program. The main tool is a document format called Jupyter Notebooks which is what you will use to do nearly all of your work in this course. Your Jupyter Notebooks will live in the cloud on the U of T's JupyterLab (or JupyterHub) system. You will also use a home-grown tool called MarkUs to submit and check your homework, and we are introducing a discussion board called Piazza where you can ask questions and get some help.  All of these are linked from Quercus, so you will have easy access. If it feels like a lot right now, don't worry, we will walk you through how to use these systems and soon it will feel routine.\n",

It's not suuuuper helpful this week, since JupyterHub is a U of T thing and Walsh expects her readers to be accessing notebooks in a slightly different way.

    "# Week 1: Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks, Programming and Python Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course you will be learning the basics of programming with a programming language called Python. We are using Python because it is relatively easy to understand, it is commonly used for introductory programming courses, and it is heavily used by professionals for data science applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "The good news is that you don't have to install Python or any software on your computer because you will be writing Python code and ordinary text in a type of document called Jupyter Notebook. Your Jupyter notebooks will be stored on a U of T hosted system called Jupyter Lab. In fact, this document is a Jupyter Notebook and you are probably reading it on Jupyter Lab (or Jupyter Hub).\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks were designed because data scientists wanted a way to document their work, and to collect together their data, code, and analyses into and easy to understand structure.  This makes it a convenient way to learn about Python and data analysis because we can work with small chunks of code and add explanations around it.\n",
