    "## A. Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of variables as containers that you can put stuff into. For instance, numbers, words, sentences, paragraphs... novels!\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables have two main aspects: \"names\" and \"values.\" The name tells Python where to look for the contents of the container. The \"value\" of the variable is that content.\n",
    "\n",
    "To put the contents into the container (as it were), you need to **assign** a **value** to the **variable**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python syntax for assigning values to variables works as follows.\n",
    "* On the left, you write out the **variable name** you want to use. These names can contain uppercase and lowercase letters A–Z, numbers 0-9, and underscores (`_`). You *cannot* use other punctuation (`.-!?` etc.), or spaces. You can use *pretty much* any name you want, though a few names are reserved for Python's own use, such as `print` and `return` (these special words will appear in green text when you enter them into a Jupyter code cell).\n",
    "* Then you put a *single equals sign*, `=` (don't use a double equals sign, `==`, which we'll talk about in a second). \n",
    "* Then write out the **value** that you want to **assign** to the variable (aka, the stuff you want to put into the envelope). If it's text you want to put into the variable, surround it in quotation marks (`\"` — or `'` if you're British, either works!). If it's a number, just write the number.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may at some point hear that it's \"cool\" or \"efficient\" to use really short variable names like `f` or `n`. Nonsense!!! We know lots of words, so let's not be afraid to use them! A descriptive variable name — one that actually makes clear what kind of stuff is inside the envelope — makes your code more readable (to yourself and others) and reinforces your sense of what's actually going on in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: if you're going to use more than one word for your variable name, it is conventional and reader-friendly to use an underscore `_` to separate these words, rather than just mashing them together. This is called (get ready for it) **snake_case**!\n",
    "\n",
